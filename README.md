# VercelClone Project Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the VercelClone project, detailing its architecture, the technologies employed across its services, and the exposed API endpoints.

---

## 1. Project Overview

VercelClone is a monorepo project designed to emulate the functionalities of platforms like Vercel. Its primary goal is to facilitate the building and deployment of web applications through an integrated process that includes Git repository linking, automated build pipelines, and efficient static asset hosting.

The project is structured into four distinct, interconnected services, each playing a crucial role in the deployment lifecycle:

*   **Frontend**: The user-facing application for interaction.
*   **API Server**: The central backend for managing project data and orchestrating operations.
*   **Build Server**: Responsible for the build process of user projects.
*   **S3 Reverse Proxy**: Handles serving deployed applications.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

The VercelClone platform is designed with a microservices architecture, where each service is specialized for a particular set of tasks.

### 2.1. Component Breakdown

*   **Frontend**:
    The main user interface built with Next.js and React. It enables users to create and manage projects, link Git repositories, initiate deployments, and monitor the status of their builds and deployments. It communicates with the API Server for administrative tasks and utilizes Socket.IO for real-time updates, such as streaming build logs.

*   **API Server**:
    This service acts as the central nervous system of the backend. Developed with Express.js, it exposes a suite of REST APIs for core functionalities including project creation, deployment initiation, and retrieval of deployment logs. It integrates with:
    *   **Prisma**: For persistent data storage and management in a PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Kafka**: For asynchronous communication, such as dispatching build requests to the Build Server.
    *   **AWS SDK for ECS**: To programmatically manage and launch containerized build environments.
    *   **ClickHouse**: For efficient storage and querying of analytical data, particularly deployment logs.
    *   **Socket.IO**: To push real-time updates and logs to connected Frontend clients.

*   **Build Server**:
    A dedicated worker service that operates in response to build requests. It consumes messages from a Kafka queue, clones the specified Git repository, executes the project's build commands (e.g., `npm install`, `next build`), and subsequently uploads the generated static assets or other build artifacts to an AWS S3 bucket.

*   **S3 Reverse Proxy**:
    This service functions as a gateway for serving the deployed applications. Built with Express.js and leveraging `http-proxy`, it intercepts incoming HTTP requests. Based on domain or subdomain routing logic, it proxies these requests to the corresponding AWS S3 bucket where the static build artifacts are stored. This setup allows for custom domain mapping and potentially provides additional features like SSL termination.

### 2.2. Data Flow Example: Project Deployment

This sequence illustrates a typical project deployment workflow:

1.  **User Initiates Project Creation**: A user interacts with the **Frontend** to create a new project.
2.  **API Call for Project Creation**: The **Frontend** sends a `POST /project` request to the **API Server**.
3.  **Database Persistence**: The **API Server** stores the new project's details in the PostgreSQL database via Prisma and returns project information to the Frontend.
4.  **Deployment Request**: The user then initiates a deployment from the **Frontend**, which sends a `POST /deploy` request to the **API Server**.
5.  **Build Environment Orchestration**: The **API Server** records the deployment in PostgreSQL and uses the AWS ECS SDK to launch a new task (running the **Build Server** container). It passes critical environment variables like `GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `DEPLOYMENT_ID` to this ECS task.
6.  **Project Build and Artifact Upload**: The launched **Build Server** task clones the specified Git repository, executes the build process, and uploads the resulting output to an S3 bucket. During this process, build logs are continuously pushed to a Kafka topic.
7.  **Real-time Log Streaming and Storage**: The **API Server** consumes these logs from the Kafka topic, stores them in ClickHouse for historical analysis, and simultaneously streams them in real-time to the connected **Frontend** clients via Socket.IO.
8.  **Application Serving**: When an end-user accesses the deployed application (e.g., via a unique URL or custom domain), their request is routed through the **S3 Reverse Proxy**. This proxy retrieves and serves the static assets from the designated S3 bucket to the user.
